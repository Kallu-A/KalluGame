# KalluGame-KillTheKing
A little game of mine
### **Launch Main.java**
## The game is pretty easy:
- Every pnj is hostile except the shop
- I put some tips at the launch of the game for making him easier
- To fight an enemy you just have to take his place it will make a "round" of fight each of you will take the damage of you"r attack if the enemy die in the round you go on is body
- There is mine hidden who can make pretty though damage but with the object in the first shop "View the hidden" all of them will be revealed
- Each level of armour is a gain of **10% less damage**
- The life and damage of the enemy is exponential don't try to kill a Gorila or a Dragon with the basic sword
- Warning when you buy a weapon she is not the current item but you can change it with **E**
## All the commands :
- **A: open the store if there is shop in the nearby 1 case all around you for buying**
- **R: open the store if there is shop in the nearby 1 case all around you for selling you'r item**
- **E: open the inventory and you can change the current item**
- **Z: scan the nearby enemy 1 case all around you**
- **Q: show all the commands of the game in the game**
- **SPACE : revive you if you're dead but it's a cheat**
- **L : launch a new game**
